Hello everybody,
<br/>I've been using Nix since I started studying Computer Science in 2011. After two semesters I changed from CS to Geoinformatics, and since then I'm trying to avoid the proprietary OS we have to use at Uni.
<br/>Until now I managed to do all the my University Stuff on my various GNU/Linux machines (Thinkpad Netbook and Desktop both running Fedora).
<br/>I've distro hopped through every major GNU/* Distro and a few *BSDs until I settled for Fedora. I also tried nearly ever Desktop Environment and Window Manager out there until I settled for dwm.
<br/>But to be honest: this isn't the first time in my Distro hopping history that I felt like I finally found my setup :)

So... where to start!
<br/>
<br/>To get the boring stuff out of the way, I'm a 16 year old American unix-nub that has only been using GNU/Linux for a little over a year. First started off dual-booting with Ubuntu and Windows, then got rid of the Windows partition. Eventually I got disgusted with Ubuntu's package manager (mostly just some dependency issues.) That little fiasco has led me to Slackware.
<br/>
<br/>Perhaps some more interesting things: I love me some keyboards, have three mechanical keyboards, and I'm looking to pick up some more when I get some money.
<br/>for the curious, they are:
<br/>1. Happy Hacking Keyboard
<br/>2. Steelseries 6gv2
<br/>3. Leopold FC200R (Browns, no numpad, no lettering).
<br/>
<br/>Next thing!
<br/>Emacs vs Vim: Emacs. Though i've pimped it out to be more like vim. Mainly because I liked how vim worked, but Emacs lisp and all the customization possibilities is a pleasure to goof off with.
<br/>Otherwise, I'm a unicyclist, like playing Dwarf Fortress, like playing quake, used to play lots of StarCraft and Dota. Trying to learn German. Attempting to learn C and Python, not having the best of luck, but I'm still trudging along :)
<br/>

Could I be a moderator please? I looked around but couldn't find anywhere to submit an application. I'm suitable for a moderator position because of my excellent communication and management skills. I was nearly allowed to be a moderator on another forum once, if that counts towards my cause. If an admin could just shoot me an email sometime, that'd be greatâ€”thanks.
<br/>
<br/>Right, I also know some basic Unix commands like "echo", "netcat", "type", "cd", and "fork"...
<br/>
<br/>I haven't used a forum in a long time. I used to love forumsâ€”joining forums, running forums, designing forums, imagining forums, you name itâ€”maybe I still will enjoy forums. I don't want to bring up any grudges, but nobody would ever let me be a moderator. I can't figure out why, certainly not why anybody would pick Zamurick over me! I woulda moderated the hell outta that forum, too... I'm moderator material through and through. You've gotta believe me, serious as a shock-induced heart attack when I'm alone in the dark, scary, cold forest with nothing but my perpetual longing for the responsibility of a moderator position on a medium-sized forum of relevant interest... In the forest, hunting trolls and flamers (who pose a threat to a certain bear) and spammers and being so deeply alone with nothing but the century old anchors of lives so much more meaningful than my own. There is a creak, a rustle, one more forum to have my devices with, foreboding something unfulfilling, so satisfyingâ€”a forum following all the right distributions, a forum which I can surely call home and escape this dreary, freezing anathema of hell.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>I'm tired, it's relatively late. Not trolling, dry humor. Been using *nix systems for a few years, programming for a few yearsâ€”C, Java, PHP (revolting!), JavaScript which is not at all related to Java (if that gives me any credibility here seeing that it's a common misconception), poking around in a few other languages, which is really insignificant... Some web design, graphic designâ€”Minecraft lately, a real killer. I also like to cook, read, and appreciate nature from behind a window.

<br/>I'm an elite hacker and I'm glad to meet you all.

Well I never made post introducing myself so ya. I'm a computer enthusiast like everyone else on this board.
<br/>I have been using unix based operating systems since I was in grade 4 in school we ran Ubuntu(don't remember what version)
<br/> I never really got into customization and was never really that interested in computers until about 2-3 years ago.
<br/>I first became interested in computers when I found some old computer programming books of my parents.
<br/>I started off learning C++ but got frustrated and quit so my dad taught me HTML and I've been hooked on anything computer related since.
<br/>I know C#, Visual Basic, fairly fluentlt but not completely and I know the basics of Java, C, C++, Python, Ruby, Qbasic, Ajax, and javascript.
<br/>I love learning new things about computers and the way they work any chance I get it is litterly one of the main things that drives me in life as sad as that may sound :P.

Greetings all.<a href="http://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=382">Thread</a>

<p>
Hello there, I have grown sick of a forum that shall remained unnamed. Although, I am sure most, if not all, of you know of this forum.
<br/>
<br/>I've decided to finally make the move over to UnixHub. I am positive I will not be disappointed in my decision. Especially being as I will be part of an international forum brought together by a common ground that is *nix, instead of what people call "hacking."
<br/>
<br/>I feel as though the atmosphere will be intireily(SP?) different, as I can be more lax here. I don't have to watch what I post because I'd have to worry about some kid bothering and pestering me. I am sure my knowledge in the *nix field will be greater grown here at UnixHub rather than it will be anywhere else.
<br/>
<br/>But here is some back story on myself.
<br/>
<br/>I am in the United Stated Army. I am a 25B, which is a Technology Information Specialist. I am also airborne, I jump out of planes. I like a variety of music genres, and I'm pretty laid back. Oh, and I play xbox.
<br/>
<br/>I use *nix constantly, it has become my pride and joy in the past years. It's become my outlet in times of stress, and it has become my precious child as I grow it myself. I'm probably going to make the move over to FreeBSD here soon, moving away from Arch Linux. I will probably end up using both, however. I feel as though getting more into *BSD will get me closer to my goal, though.
<br/>
<br/>Thanks guys.

<br/>I love Unix based operating systems,

<br/>Lembas, if I remember correctly, gave me the advice to install Gentoo.
<br/>I installed it, liked it, but it was more of a learning lesson.
<br/>Then I wanted to move to CRUX, which I didn't do.
<br/>I started using NetBSD instead.
<br/>After loving it (except PKG_SRC, since it's most of the time outdated).
<br/>After that I knew that I would love BSD for the rest of my live
<br/>I decided to move on, I started using FreeBSD.

Hey guys, wassup,, my first post here. I usually hang out in the irc, and recently wanted to remain active in the forums as well.

<br/>So hi everyone, how are you all. I am using Arch Linux on my laptop. Recently had a gaming discussion with nixers on the irc and now I am hooked on dota 2.
<br/>
<br/>My aim for being here is to learn more about linux, how things work under the hood. I am also looking to participate in one or two open source competitions.
<br/>
<br/>I just love the customizations that you guys do with your linux boxes,
<br/>and I also want myself to be able to do the same on my own, that's the aim for me being here. And I hope that being with you guys I would be able to get what I want.!!

Hi All, have lurked here and there, and today, decided to join. Been a bit weary of joining another community after the demise of muchville. I also recently happened to be perusing the forums here and was sad to see the unixhub drama. Glad to see you were able to come back together and spawn a new community.

<br/>Main WM's are herbst, monster, cwm. Currently running back and forth between LinuxBBQ Colin, and LinuxBBQ Gruffalo, base is debian sid.
<br/>
<br/>I try to contribute what and when I can. Most of my contributions live over at the grill. Lately with RL, I mainly browse from my mobile while commuting on the train.   Weekends usually bring more time for catching up on website, github, and forum activity.

Some months ago I found a screenshot of an awesome looking i3wm-setup which led me to /r/unixporn. And a few weeks ago a screenshot in /r/unixporn led me to this community. After lurking around, watching and waiting I finally decided that it was time to hit "Register" and join you.
<br/>
<br/>It's considered normal to write something about yourself in this section - it's called "Introduction" for a reason, isn't it? But I always have had problems describing myself. Let's give it a try:
<br/>I've been in love with computers ever since I got my hands on one around fifteen years ago, but of course my passion focused on video games at first (And somehow still does, I'm spending more time than I should enjoying beautiful storylines and discovering worlds unknown to mankind. Well, virtual worlds of course.). A more technical interest started to develop around six or seven years ago.
<br/>
<br/>I discovered Linux and learned to love it (I guess my path was pretty similar to most other people's experiences: Ubuntu - Debian - Arch - place_exotic_distribution_few_people_use_in_here - Debian.) following this discovery I tried out nearly everything that sounds fun, from programming to systems administration, information security and encryption and license philosophy (I liked the GPL once. I was young.). After a short rendez-vous with a local university without much of what's generally called "success" I'm now working as a technician. And yep, I'm regretting that I was too lazy to ever really get my ass behind learning stuff instead of just looking at it.
<br/>
<br/>I'm currently using a Macbook Pro with the original operating system on it, but I'm thinking about getting a cheap notebook and make the switch back to FreeBSD. In virtual machines I'm fiddling around with tiling window managers, color schemes and vim all the time. So this might be a logical step.
<br/>
<br/>Beneath all computer-related stuff I'm not very thrilling either. I like books, music and science as much as your average nerd and avoid social contacts almost at the same level. So let's try to give a summary: Computer-loving guy that somehow has never managed to aquire an appropriate skillset but instead manages his way through everything by Trial and Error and a dash of Google Fu. (And if you ever need useless knowledge, you know where to ask. \\o/)
<br/>
<br/>And for the really lazy people, aka TL;DR: I'm happy to finally be here after a period of lurking around dark corners and watching everything. I'm looking forward to all this and I hope I'm not that annoying because of me being odd from time to time. (Sidenote: Yes, I sometimes write long post. I've got problems with expressing myself in short ways. I'm, honestly, sorry.)

Hey all. Glad to finally find a Unix/Linux forum that I can actually post on!
<br/>
<br/>I'm having trouble trying to find a place to start with Unix and C programming. I want to avoid college so that I don't send myself further into debt. I have an aptitude for learning extremely quickly. I was Army EOD (the school is all memorizing and scoring 90% or better on every test and only 2 hours of studying a night (has a 95% fail rate)) so I'm sure I can handle this.
<br/>
<br/>I have an older computer (windows xp age) but I'm sure it'll be sufficient enough to run Unix for practice and such.
<br/>
<br/>I just need a push in the right direction with what tools I will need as well as what books and programs I'll have to pick up to start learning my future career.
<br/>
<br/>Thanks!

Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>After some monthes lurking here, finally decided to post this introduction.
<br/>
<br/>I'm lidstah (the "stah" is an old story :]), a sysadmin from France. Back in the old days I was an Amiga user (still have my good ol' A1200 running), and switched to gnu/linux for main use in 1996 (ah, slackware). Believe it or not, I've never used windowsÂ® at home (it's another story at work, sadly, but things are improving :p).
<br/>
<br/>Nowadays, I mainly use Arch for my desktop and my everyday's laptop, Debian on my servers and OpenBSD at work (and on my good old Thinkpad T60).
<br/>
<br/>In my spare time, I enjoy "coding" (well, mostly some "bidouillage" (french word, kind of hacking but in a low level way) in C, Perl, Go and bash), some gaming, playing around with obscure operating systems (I'm looking at you, Plan9 From Bell Labs), hanging around with friends, IRC (I'm an IRC addict since 1995), listening to music, and to participate to the associative life of my city (I'm a member of our local LUG, and of a local associative internet provider (FAImaison, member of the FFDN)).
<br/>

<br/>I saw this forum advertised so I thought I'd join. :)
<br/>
<br/>I've been using GNU/Linux for around 4 years, I'm a bit of a distro hopper but I've realised that for now, Linux Mint is my favourite.

<br/>I would also like to make the most out of Conky. :)
<br/>
<br/>I will probably one day switch to BSD, as I've heard good reviews on it.
<br/>I completely moved away from Windows around 3 years ago and never turned back.
<br/>My dream career is to one day work with Linux/Nix systems.
<br/>
<br/>Some of you may have seen me before, I roam around on HF.
<br/>That place is rubbish now though, and I can't even be bothered looking at the Linux section again lol.
<br/>
<br/>I honestly never thought moving from Wincrap to Linux taught me so much more about computing, file systems, networking etc.
<br/>
<br/>My hope for the future is to get back into programming and create some multi platform applications.
<br/>
<br/>If I ever do create any applications or scripts they will always be open source to the public.
<br/>
<br/>Sorry for the long intro!
<br/>I hope you guys enjoy having me here! :)

Greetings, nixers!
<br/>
<br/> I have been using GNU/Linux full-time since Spring of last year, finally severing ties with Windows 7. (No hard feelings, though.) Despite the (IMHO) dreadful Unity interface, Ubuntu was a breath of fresh air and a welcome respite from the plebian masses plugged into botnet OS's. It enlivened me, and gave me the will to pursue Unix-based OS's further, something I am grateful to the project for.
<br/>
<br/> I went on to experiment with openSUSE, Fedora, Arch, CentOS, Mint, et.al. gleaning from each skills which helped me with the next. Now I have begun to quite enjoy the Debian project, and have pursued it further than the others, developing a taste for the riced desktop :)

Hello there, nixers!
<br/>Since i've registered here for some time now and even posted a pretty clumsy thread about 2bwm, I decided to go back a step and start introducing myself. I go with Linux for about 2 or three years now, and discovered an affection for ricing and tweaking for me. The reason for this was basically because I did not like the stock Linux GUIs and needed something different. When stepping over to this, some other stuff like doing more and more scripts followed. I had some contact to z3bra and I am pretty happy that your blog is back up. So, i guess i matured a bit and want to Get started now with going Crazy with *nix-stuff. First of all, i try to set up irssi, what Sounds like Black Magic atm to me. Okay, thats it for now, i Hope we will get to know each other on irc soon! :)

Hello! I'm a long time hardware enthusiast, and more recently (last 5 years), a *nix enthusiast; overclocking, efficiency, and low-level tinkering. I'm currently rocking an EVGA 680 4GB running at 1408mHz GPU core, and a 3770k running at 4.7gHz, with a relatively small and hardened Arch Linux install on btrfs.
<br/>
<br/>I have what you might consider esoteric, but what is in reality just a radical and powerful political stance, of which I relate to software. I don't support the status quo of large corporations that rule the world through corrupt governments - I fight this concept everyday with my actions, my words, and my faith in the concept of a free world, a free nation, and a free human race. The only problem with my faith in a truly free world is that we can't have it as we are without major change; a revolution. *nix offers a way to help decentralize the powers of large conservative corporations, and I appreciate that more than most people realize. It isn't just a free OS, or an alternative to Windows - it's a lifestyle, a replacement.
<br/>
<br/>On top of that, I'm a classically trained classical alto saxophone player, as well, and dabble in most woodwind instruments (love the clarinet, but I play it like I play the sax).
<br/>
<br/>I'm glad to have found this community, and hope to contribute as much as my time allows.

Hello,
<br/>
<br/>I figured I should re-make my introduction!  I originally joined looking for Joomla, and once I found him.  I was going to force him to help me out with all my unix questions, but then I realized I didn't have time in my semester to learn something non-related to the five courses I was already taken, so being overwhelmed I stopped.  But the fire in me to learn Unix hasn't left me yet!  I'm off school and plan on spending a few months no-living this.
<br/>
<br/>I'm Oz, I come from Canada living in Alberta (Under this fucking snow).  I'm seventeen, Athletic, weird, love coffee, and love to learn.  I live for stressful scenarios and learning new things.  I work at Starbucks as a Barista trainer and shift supervisor.
<br/>
<br/>I've been inspired to learn Unix once I realized a few things.  The world we live in, and the world we will live in years down the road is dominated by technology, and it seams like Unix is the foundaiton of the majority of it.  I have a long list of things I want to learn relating to this large goal, and Unix is one of them!
<br/>
<br/>I am currently on a Macbook Pro 13in Retina display, with OSX.  On a virtualbox I have booted a FreeBSD (Or trying to install successfully, at least).  I plan to have a dual boot, and work up to a single boot of FreeBSD, or another BSD OS.

<br/>So yeah, that's me.  How are you all doing?

<br/>I've been all warm and cozy on Arch Linux for a while now but I'm looking to checkout BSD on one of my other machines and explore UNIX a bit further!
<br/>
<br/>Apart from all the geeky stuff: Drink, girls, tattoos, video games (huge Halo fan), and many other things people probably don't care about! :P

<br/>I look forward to the future discussions in this, what already seems to be, great forum!

<br/>Anyway, I'm z3bra, an apprentice in CS engineering. I discovered linux 2 years ago (oct. 2011, happy birthday) with ubuntu. I switched to arch 5 month later and now, most of my computers run this (server, desktop, laptop, school VM).
<br/>I also have set up CRUX on my notebook for basic operations like ssh-ing to servers and coding. I'm planning to setup a firewall over OpenBSD soon.
<br/>
<br/>In my spare time, I enjoy coding, skateboarding, climbing and gaming.
<br/>For each of 'em, here is a quick introduction:
<br/>- C/C++, Java, shell, php, brainfuck, asm
<br/>- alien workshop / independent trucks / spitfire wheels
<br/>- Climbing up to 6c/7a (5.11a to 5.11d USA)
<br/>- AMD A10-5800k / Nvidia GTX 650 Ti / 1440x900

<br/>I mostly play Quake Live / Quake 3 defrag, but I enjoy when games are runnable through wine (eg: Id software Rage)

A while back in time, scanning thru my glasses at the #! desktop thread, I saw a user give a shout out to this place called "UNIXHUB" in his scrot.  It's not until today tho, that I have actually decided to see as to whether or not the site was legit.
<br/>
<br/>And off the bat, you guys don't disappoint!  The site is very minimal and attractive, like those homes on the lakefront: minimal and yet full of storage compartments.
<br/>
<br/>This does not seem much of an intro tho to who I am, then again on all the forums I have posted I have never gotten this right.  And on one forum I was kicked out for deciding to write my intro in mint green font,  a personal favorite color of mine.  Not because I was judged on the color but because they assumed any color other then black is yelling.
<br/>
<br/>Anyway without a further delay....
<br/>
<br/>I have loved computers since the day I was in the first grade.  I went to private school and they didn't always buy the latest equipment... or a lot of equipment.  Our library only had twenty computers within its long shelves of non beaten up books.  So the privilege of using them went mostly to the eight graders and when they were not using them to do boring things - looking at high school sports for example.  The lab was open to any of the lower grades.
<br/>
<br/>Our teacher thought it would be cool to explore the realm of the computer.  The things were massive and grey.  The first ever application I used was paint, I drew lines on top of lines because kids with mice don't really work out to well.  I also performed my first GOOGLE search on there for "Book reports on Junie B. Jones books" and my second "How to lie and not get caught", those search's saved my life a couple of times.
<br/>
<br/>And as I aged so did the school.  Eventually they ditched the old 90's HP machines and got newer HP's (it's here that I learned HP's always overheat).  Every year students hate coming back to school, but in the fourth grade while everyone else was thinking about joining band I looked into the newly formed computer club.  It's here where I first saw the inside of a computer and thought "That's a massive city they have in there! " and "Sony should sue these people for naming something PS1".  After being in the computer club until I went to public school in the seventh grade, I understood what I wanted to do in life.  I wanted to work with computers.  Sadly tho there was no computer club to join.
<br/>
<br/>In High School, I joined all the classes that had to deal with computers.  From computer servicing to networking, where I ran in the Cisco Netriders and finished third in my cities area and fourth in state, sadly it ended there because they only took the top two teams. To computer apps where I achieved a MS Office certificate and finally keyboarding.  The school was also pretty cool in the fact that since the junk computer parts where of no use to them they put it in a hallway.  My friends took two projectors that was in working order side a non-working lamp that would have put them back $600 USD.  I only made away with a Intel Core 2 DUO computer that the caps were all dead and a Nvidia gefore 7300 LE.
<br/>
<br/>I started to use Linux on Halloween day in 2010 using Ubuntu 10.10, and after many distro changes, am still using it today.
<br/>
<br/>*unix is something that will always stick with me and hope to use in future careers.  Currently I am planning to attend Hartford University for a Dual major in Computer Science and Web Development.  All of this may sound enticing, but in reality I'm not that "cool".  In my spare time I love to watch The Amazing World of Gumball and Rabbids, as well as play Linux's Nexuiz.   I am not much of a gamer tho, only going on there to talk to some close mates from around the world.  I don't play any instruments, don't have a girlfriend, don't have a twitter, or other social network site.  So basically one can call me Patrick from Spongebob, because I really do enjoy being lazy.
<br/>
<br/>So to summarize:
<br/>
<br/>I am a computer loving guy that never was really cool to people who did not know the difference from a mofset and a capacitor, but I do like TV and being rather lazy.  I am looking forward to being here with you guys and elaborating on things.
<br/>
<br/>And maybe some *BSD folks can help me compile a minimal kernel.

<br/>I'm a Physics student by day and by night I like to tinker a lot with stuff to make it more efficient or just a bit less of a hassle to use. Really anything from motorcycles through multitools to computers.
<br/>
<br/>I started off on Unix systems with Linux about 3.5 years ago after hearing about it from a lot of people on the websites I used to hang out on at the time. I distro hopped for a while before settling on Archlinux. Haven't yet tried any other *nixes to a serious extent but I'm planning to real soon.
<br/>
<br/>I'm usually just pumping out code for the course or doodling around with making all sorts of things like encryption, install scripts and games or other, sometimes with others.
<br/>
<br/>I got here by meeting gurhush on 420chan IRC and having an extended conversation that eventually covered this lovely place.

Hi, I'm klr, from sweden. I've used GNU/Linux since my first computer, currently I'm running Debian but I gonna switch to Source Mage when I got some time. I have tried FreeBSD, and will try OpenBSD and/or MirOS BSD, if I need a server I'll run one of those three on it probably. I'm also studying C, just recently started. I hope I am welcome and can share some of my knowledge and learn from yours.

Hey everyone! Some of you might know me already i am Red1403 from HF.<br/>I am 19 years old and lived in Wales all my life. Always had a habit to play around. At the age of 5 I started playing around with this PC I had, that had Windows 98 installed on it. When I was 16 I had a laptop with a HD that was failing and so i used the Ubuntu live-CD for about 2 months to do my college work. I then used it to rescue documents and pictures from computers that would not boot. I then went back to it Christmas 2010 since I got a netbook that was really slow with Windows 7 Starter Edition. I went to Debian not long ago and experimented with many distributions like Arch and many Debian based such as Crunchbang. I gave my HD to a friend few weeks ago and since i could not re-master Debian properly so I had to use Ubuntu to create a custom CD in order to carry on using my netbook. More to the story but those are the basics. <br/><br/>I have met many awesome people on IRC and i hope to see you all around :) <br/>See you all around xD

Greetings everyone!
<br/>
<br/>I'm eksith. Nice to meet you.
<br/>
<br/>Consultant, developer/programmer, designer, amateur therapist type -- who's not particularly great at any of them -- with mild OCD here. I usually get drafted to do something else from whatever it is I'm doing at the moment. No complaints (that's a massive lie).
<br/>
<br/>I enjoy taking apart things for no particular reason. My folks tell me this was a problem since I discovered a screwdriver.
<br/>Anyhoo...
<br/>
<br/>Wee bit of background:
<br/>I've dabbled in multiple variants of *nix, but these days, I tend to hover around OpenBSD because I'm incredibly lazy at times and this is one OS that doesn't need constant baby sitting. Remember the good ol' days when a bunch of shell scripts ran your universe? Yeah, those were (are? Well, they ought to be be!) good times.
<br/>
<br/>My first *nix system was FreeBSD and my first proper tutorial that I followed end-to-end was setting up a cvsup server. I think this was around 2003-ish.
<br/>
<br/>These days I've been working on writing, re-writing, re-re-writing very simple utilities and tinkering with electronics as a hobby or if I'm not in the mood, I relax with a bit of Anime. I have terrible spelling and grammar so it takes just slightly more than the half-life of Americium-241 to finish a sentence I care about (I started writing this in 1581 with a quill dipped in yak dung).
<br/>
<br/>[ I'm originally from the Windows world with a whole complicated history there, but that's not applicable here ;) ]
<br/>
<br/>How I got here :
<br/>From Hacker News, oddly enough, when I asked D9u about his off-grid setup a couple of months back. Off-grid and sustainable living are dreams of mine. Long story short, I want my sustainable cabin to be tendered by robots. Preferably running some variant of Debian or OpenBSD.
<br/>
<br/>In my usual cart-before-horse fashion, I signed up before lurking much so... yeah. ;)

<br/>I use Arch Linux as my desktop OS and Debian on the servers and I've been
<br/>curious about the BSDs for a while, although I haven't tried any of them yet.

I'm a Canadian high school student that finally moved away from Win7 to Ubuntu 13.04 this year. I've always wanted to learn more about *nix systems and found this forum through /r/unixporn on Reddit. You guys have such an awesome community who are willing to help out noobs so I'm probably going to lurk and learn your wizardly magic.
<br/>
<br/>I spend most of my time lately practising Calligraphy and tinkering in Ubuntu with a little side gaming. I'm hoping to move over to a much more customizable system and get out of the kiddie pool into more advanced stuff this summer.

I'm a computer science student from Canada and I really like working with networking and computer hardware. After I graduate I'd like to work as a sysadmin.
<br/>
<br/>I've been using GNU/Linux since around 2008. I started out using Ubuntu, but now I run Arch on some of my machines and Debian on my home server.
<br/>
<br/>My free time is spent learning new things and gaming. I'm currently really into wireless technologies and hope to get my ham radio license this summer.

theconjuring here. My real name is Berk, I'm 16 years old. I reside in Turkey, study in Bornova Anatolian Highschool.
<br/>
<br/>I've always been interested in computers, and decided to take this further in 2012, installed Arch Linux on my computer and began from there. I do a little programming, and I'm learning more of it every day.
<br/>
<br/>I listen to a lot of heavy metal and progressive rock, along with 80s Pop and New Wave. I like to eat lots of food. I'm 104kg, 192cm, and look fat. I watch Parks & Recreation, Game of Thrones and HIMYM. I don't have a girlfriend. I'm short-sighted (-1.5/-1.0), wear eyeglasses and have a very limited choice of clothing. I take a bath three times a week.
<br/>
<br/>I don't do anything involving frequent move of legs and hands. No sports. I kinda' want to lose some weight though. Could take some advice.

Hello everyone. I found this forum basically because I browse /r/unixporn a lot and people always have it in screenshots so I figured I'd give it a go.
<br/>
<br/>My first experience with a *nix OS was about 2005 with FreeBSD. It was a basic shell account where I learned how to set up an IRC server. Ever since then I have learned to depend on *nix for all of my server needs. I started small with shells then moved to full VPS boxes where I built my own stack and configured, secured my own stuff which was a great learning experience. My preferred OS for servers is Debian.
<br/>
<br/>I'm starting the slow, moderately painful transition to a Linux Desktop. Currently I am running Linux Mint 16 with Cinnamon and I like it since it mostly just works and at the end of the day I just need my desktop to work. I'm sure eventually I'll transition to a different distro.
<br/>
<br/>I'm still anchored to Windows because of gaming but that's slowly getting better, the drivers are still pretty nightmarish though and I have some bizarre issues that are brought about by dual booting.
<br/>
<br/>Anyways, I'm glad to be here. Have a nice evening all.

My real name is Nick, but online I go by nsbirl or kopri usually. I'm 22 with a few years of schooling on computers under my belt, but I broke my back a few years ago so I spend most of my time at home tinkering with computers. You guys here and on /r/unixporn have given me a lot of inspiration and ideas. Hopefully I will be able to give some back!

Hi,
<br/>
<br/>I'm gln, been lurking around the forums and IRC on and off for a while now. Thought I may as well formally introduce myself.
<br/>
<br/>I'm a Computer Science student, working mostly on embedded systems, FPGAs etc. Should be doing my masters in Electronic & Electrical Engineering after the summer.
<br/>
<br/>My interests include, robotics, tinkering, programming, cool shit, *nix etc.
<br/>
<br/>I've been using *nix for a while now. I currently run OpenBSD on my server, Crux on my desktop and currently deciding on what to put on my laptop as it's running Win 8.1 atm.
<br/>
<br/>Hopefully I can contribute something to this community.

Well, after some time lurking around, finally registered :)
<br/>
<br/>Actually working as a network and system administrator somewhere in France, I need my Unix dose on a daily basis since my work (sadly) mainly involves Microsoft's environment (but hopefully, we still have some *nix machines I can take care of ;))
<br/>
<br/>I'm mainly using gnu/linux or OpenBSD, even at work (no need of windows to use rdesktopâ€¦), either Arch for my workstation and laptops or Debian for my servers, and tend to prefer the CLI way. But in our world of pictures and videos, sometimes I need graphical interfaces, that's why I use Wmii, XMonad or ratpoison (depending on my mood - ratpoison being almost exclusively used on my laptops, and I often switch between Xmonad, wmii or dwm on my desktop computer, although I'm back on wmii since around a month - really like the tagging way of managing windows, and, yes, I'm aware about i3, but I don't really like it)
<br/>
<br/>And, here is my actual wmii config:
